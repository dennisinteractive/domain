INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Before proceeding, you must install and configure Drupal
    without installing this module.

    Note that you only need one settings directory and file.

2. Unpack the download and place it in your modules directory.

    Note the path to this directory, it is normally:

      'sites/all/modules'

3. Add the following four lines of code to your settings.php file:

/**
 * Add the custom_url_rewrite_outbound function.
 */
include './sites/all/modules/domain/settings_custom_url.inc';

    NOTE: You may need to alter the file path above based on your
    site configuration.  See INSTALL.txt for further help.
    
    NOTE: For this code to be active, you must also apply the
    custom_url_rewrite_outbound.patch distributed with the module.

4. Go to Admin > Build > Modules.  Therre you will see the Domain
    module group.

    Only enable the Domain Acccess module.

5. Configure permissions for the module, normally you will give your
    site administrators the following permissions:

    -- 'administer domains'
    -- 'set domain access'

    If you intend to use access control for editors, you may wish to set
    the following permissions:

    -- 'assign domain editors'
    -- 'edit domain nodes'

    For more information see README.txt.

6.  Read the main README.txt file for the Domain Access module.

7. Go to Admin > Build > Domain and configure the module.

8. Now you are ready to explore the options available to you.

    The Domain Access suite contains a number of optional helper
    modules.  You do not need to use any of these modules, but
    they may add features that you desire.

    Each of the modules has its own INSTALL.txt and README.txt files.
    Please read them carefully before activating them.
