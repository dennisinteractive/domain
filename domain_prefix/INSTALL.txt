1.  Introduction

Table prefixing is an advanced Drupal option; it should only be performed by
experienced admins or by those willing to learn how table prefixing functions.

This module replaces the default $db_prefix routine documented inside
settings.php.

IT IS ADVISED THAT YOU DO NOT USE THE $db_prefix VARIABLE IF
YOU ARE USING THIS MODULE.

If you must prefix all tables, do not set $db_prefix as an array.  This module
should still work if $db_prefix = 'string_'.

----
2.  Installation

In the Domain Access download, find the following file:

  domain > domain_prefix > settings_domain_prefix.inc

You will need to load this file from inside your settings.php file. There
are normally two methods for this.

----
2.1 Option 1 -- Preferred

This method is preferred, since any updates to the module release
will be reflected in this file.

NOTE: the elements inside the ==== marks are php code that
should be copied into your settings.php file.  DO NOT COPY THE ==== MARKS.

Add the following lines to the end of your settings.php file:

====
/**
 * Add the domain_prefix tables
 */
require_once './path/to/modules/domain/domain_prefix/settings_domain_prefix.inc';
====

In this case, change 'path/to/modules' with the directory where your modules are
stored.  Typically this will be 'sites/all/modules', which makes the lines:

====
/**
 * Add the domain_prefix tables
 */
require_once './sites/all/modules/domain/domain_prefix/settings_domain_prefix.inc';
====

----
2.2 Option 2

If you are having difficulty determining the correct path, copy the file
into your settings folder.

  domain > domain_prefix > settings_domain_prefix_inc

The file should be in the same directory as your active settings.php file.  Then
add the following lines:

====
/**
 * Add the domain_prefix tables
 */
require_once 'settings_domain_prefix.inc';
====

----
2.3   Testing Your Configuration

After editing your settings.php file, go to Admin > Build > Domains.  If you
see a warning at the top of the page beginning:

  "The Domain Prefix module is not installed correctly..."

This message means that your PHP server cannot find the include file.  You
may need to test other path options for the include code.

----
2.4   Additional Resources

If you are having trouble configuring the module, you should check your
PHP include path.  You may need to use an absolute path to your server root.

----
3.  Reminder

With the Domain Access module, you are running multiple sites from one
installation and one settings.php file.  The change you make to this file will
affect all active domains configured with this module.

----
4. Uninstalling

When you disable this module, you must remove the lines from your settings.php
file.
