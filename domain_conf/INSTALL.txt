----
1.  Introduction

This routine was in hook_init(), but there are cases where
the $conf array needs to be loaded in early phases of bootstrap.
In particular, these variables need to be available during variable_init().


----
2.  Installation

In the Domain Access download, find the following file:

  domain > domain_conf > settings_domain_conf.inc

You will need to load this file from inside your settings.php file. There
are two methods for this.


----
2.1 Option 1 -- Preferred

This method is preferred, since any updates to the module release
will be reflected in this file.

NOTE: the elements inside the ==== marks are php code that
should be copied into your settings.php file.  DO NOT COPY THE ==== MARKS.

Add the following lines to the end of your settings.php file:

====
/**
 * Add the domain_conf settings override
 */
require_once './path/to/modules/domain/domain_conf/settings_domain_conf.inc';
====

In this case, change 'path/to/modules' with the directory where your modules are
stored.  Typically this will be 'sites/all/modules', which makes the lines:

====
/**
 * Add the domain_conf settings override
 */
require_once './sites/all/modules/domain/domain_conf/settings_domain_conf.inc';
====

----
2.2 Option 2

If you are having difficulty determining the correct path, copy the file
into your settings folder.

  domain > domain_conf > settings_domain_conf.inc

The file should be in the same directory as your active settings.php file.  Then
add the following lines:

====
/**
 * Add the domain_conf settings override
 */
require_once 'settings_domain_conf.inc';
====

----
2.3   Testing Your Configuration

After editing your settings.php file, go to Admin > Build > Domains.  If you
see a warning at the top of the page beginning:

  "The Domain Configuration module is not installed correctly..."

This message means that your PHP server cannot find the include file.  You
may need to test other path options for the include code.

----
2.4   Additional Resources

If you are having trouble configuring the module, you should check your
PHP include path.  You may need to use an absolute path to your server root.

----
3.  Reminder

With the Domain Access module, you are running multiple sites from one
installation and one settings.php file.  The change you make to this file will
affect all active domains configured with this module.

----
4. Uninstalling

When you disable this module, you must remove the lines from your settings.php
file.
